Apart from the line of commercial units, we also offer a large-scale composting machine set up for the Asia market.<\/p>\n<p>Our machines, when paired with a grinder, and water squeezer, can increase the machine\u2019s daily composting capacity. One such example is a large-scale set in Southeast Asia.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nTMK-5000 composting machine is paired with four accessory pieces:<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n1 \u2013 Sorting Platform<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n2 \u2013 Oil and Water Separator<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n3 \u2013 Shredder<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n4 \u2013 Squeezer<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe TMK-5000 has a daily capacity of 5000kg\/day (5 tonnes).

Operators remove contamination like plastics, metals, non-organic materials, and extra-large objects from the food waste. The food waste is then pushed toward the conveyor belt and into the oil and water separator.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>Oil and Water Separator<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe oil and water separator compresses the oil and water from the food waste, to reduce the amount of moisture content within the organic waste. Through a conveyor belt system, the food waste is then moved to the shredder.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>Shredder<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe shredder is used to pulverize food waste to reduce its surface area, thus increasing the machine\u2019s daily composting capacity.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>Squeezer<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nApart from small particle size, reducing the water content in the food waste is also crucial to increasing the machine\u2019s composting capacity. The squeezer presses the food waste against a fine mesh screen to remove as much water as possible. The food waste is then transported through a conveyor belt and emptied directly into the composting machine.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nSuch large-scale composting systems are ideal for central food waste collection sites. The food waste is quickly composted in 24 hours, and the reduction rate is 80-90%. The compost can then be screened and used as a soil amendment.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n[contact-form-7 id=&#8221;2659&#8243; title=&#8221;Inquiry&#8221;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TMK Composter supplies a line of commercial composting  [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3382,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"elementor_header_footer","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3378"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3378"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3378\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3378"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3378"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3378"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
