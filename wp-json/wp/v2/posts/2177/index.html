Small-scale composting cuts transport costs and waste taxes, giving back a fertile outcome that is highly rich in nutrients. This compost increases the soil fertility of agricultural fields, pots, and green areas.\u00a0\u00a0Organic waste stops being polluting waste and it is turned into a resource, raw biomass able to fertilize the soil and generate new products. Composting offers a viable alternative to poor centralized waste management, paving the way for the circular economy.\u00a0<strong>Benefits of Composting<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>1. Environmental Benefit:<\/strong> With food waste composters you can cut transport costs and considerably reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfill or burns. This way composting reduces GHGs and groundwater pollution. It helps people that want to take part in a new cycle of social cooperation and co-responsibility.\u00a0<strong>2. Practical Benefit:<\/strong> Damp and smelly organic waste bags are replaced by efficient and odorless composters that can be controlled remotely. Composting optimizes processes and returns fertile and nutrient soil, reusable in every garden, planter, or vase.\u00a0<strong>3. Economic Benefit:<\/strong> In the mechanism of circular economy management costs are offset by the transformation of waste into a resource.Composting is the only possible solution to mitigate the environmental impact.https:\/\/youtu.be\/lVSvQAGw0LY<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Electromechanical composters reduce the environmental i [&#8230;]\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":2190,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"elementor_header_footer","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2177"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2177"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2177\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2177"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2177"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2177"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
