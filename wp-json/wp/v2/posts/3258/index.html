This natural process saves you resources, improves the quality of your soil, and it reduces environmental degradation. The moment you understand the benefits, you will always find it to be something worthwhile to do.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nComposting is responsible for fertilizing your garden. It enriches the soil with various nutrients and valuable microorganisms that enhance the growth of your plants. Whenever you need to boost the productivity of your land, you will not need to resort to the use of chemical fertilizers that end up polluting your environment. Composting is also known to improve the stability of your soil, facilitate drainage as well as moisture retention.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nYou will need to compost because it is the most effective way of reducing the amount of waste that your family or your community can take to the landfill. According to Environmental Protection Agency, about 30% of all waste released to the environment is food waste. Apart from reducing harmful gases that are responsible for global warming, composting food waste also controls the litter and the odor in the environment.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>You can easily justify the need to compost garden waste with the following reasons:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>It saves you money because:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nYou will not need to purchase chemical fertilizers when compost manure is freely available.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe ability of your soil to retain moisture improves. This, therefore, reduces the amount of water you may need to supply for irrigation.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe nutrients from the compost do not go to waste because they are not prone to erosion.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>It saves you other resources because:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nWith compost, you can keep a vital resource outside the landfill.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nYou will require less water for use in your garden because compost has moisture retention properties.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe costs associated with waste collection will definitely reduce, and there would be no need for use of any type of fuel.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost can lengthen the life of landfills. You will note that garden waste consists of 40% organic materials, 42% potentially recyclable materials, and 18% of other materials.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>It improves your soil fertility because:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost replenishes important nutrients in the soil. This helps in maintaining the quality and fertility of the soil.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost is known to be a mild, natural fertilizer which is released slowly into the soil. It does not damage the soil in the manner that chemical fertilizers do.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost makes the texture of the soil better. It also improves air circulation in heavy soils.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost supplies valuable organic materials and humus that make plants to flourish. This increases farm productivity.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nCompost helps in controlling weeds leading to improved health of plants.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\n<strong>It reduces negative environmental impact because:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nGreen House Gases (GHGs) are reduced in the following two ways :<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nA. Composting eliminates transportation of the food waste. Therefore, the carbon dioxide (CO2) that would have been emitted to the environment by motor vehicles is avoided.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nB. Composting curtails the anaerobic breaking down of organic matter in landfills. Therefore, there would not be any methane gas emitted to the environment. Methane is known to be 21 times more harmful than carbon dioxide.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nSince composting limits the use of chemical fertilizers, water sources such as rivers, lakes, and streams are not polluted.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe possibility of groundwater pollution is less because composting prevents buried organic matter reacting with metals to create toxic leachate.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nGarbage volume in the environment becomes less.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe beauty of composting is that you create a natural cycle whereby you return the plants you grow back to the soil and use them to grow a new generation of plants, some of which come back to the table as food. You just need to make a small investment of time so that you can make a valuable contribution to your community.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nYou will be able to solve for them the problem of waste disposal and at the same time enrich the soil, and improve the productivity of your yard as you protect the environment. Composting Garden waste in particular may not be a pleasant endeavor, but the wide range of its benefits drives you to always like and do it. This is a process that the world desperately needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The need to compost garden waste is clearly expressed b [&#8230;]\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3261,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"elementor_header_footer","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3258"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3258"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3258\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3258"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3258"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3258"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
