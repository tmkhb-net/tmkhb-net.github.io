A variety of popular smaller-scale domestic composting methods have been developed also. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on where you want to compost, how much space you have available, the amount of compost you would like to make, the cost of buying or making the composter, and the time you have available to maintain or harvest your compost.<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1020\" height=\"973\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-1024x977.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-1024x977.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-300x286.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-768x733.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-500x477.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process-800x763.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/composting-process.jpg 1152w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<p><strong>Industrial-Scale Composting<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Open windrow composting is used for processing garden waste (such as grass cuttings, pruning, and leaves) in either an open-air environment or within large covered areas where the material can break down in the presence of oxygen.<\/p>\n<strong>Size<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nOpen windrow composting is large-scale and needs lots of space for storing and processing waste.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Process<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nFeedstock is shredded, mixed, and formed into windrows (long lines) along a non-permeable surface.\nWindrows are turned on a regular basis to regulate their oxygen, heat, and moisture content.\nThe final step involves the screening of the compost and removal of contaminants such as plastics or metals, as well as grading the compost for various end uses.

This system ensures that composting takes place in an enclosed and controlled environment to ensure that any pathogens present in the waste material are destroyed. This technique is commonly used to convert organic waste, including food and garden waste mixtures, to a suitable state for use as a soil conditioner.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Process<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nStage 1 (1\u20133 weeks): The local authority food waste collection arrives at an enclosed reception area. It is then shredded and placed into a bay\/tunnel were naturally occurring micro-organisms begin to break down the food waste, releasing nutrients and, in doing so, increasing the temperature within the composter to the 60\u201370\u2103 needed to kill pathogens and weed seeds, and meet the regulations for processing Animal Bi-Product (ABP) material.\n\u00a0\nStage 2 (1\u20133 weeks): The composting material is transferred to a second bay\/tunnel where the composting process continues. Processing in three stages ensures that all parts of the composting mass reach the required temperature. The oxygen level, moisture, and temperature are carefully monitored and controlled during both composting stages to ensure the material is fully sanitized.\n\u00a0\nStage 3 (10\u201314 weeks): Once the sanitization process is complete, the compost is left to mature in either an enclosure or an open windrow to fully mature.\n<strong>Anaerobic Digestion<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nAnaerobic digestion (AD) is the process whereby organic matter, including food waste, animal waste, and sewage sludge, is broken down in the presence of microorganisms to produce biogas and digestate fertiliser. This process happens in the absence of oxygen in a sealed, oxygen-free tank called an anaerobic digestor.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Size<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nAD composters vary in size; industrial-scale composters require significant machinery and storage space.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Process<\/strong>\n\u00a0\n<ul>\n<li>Organic waste arrives at an anearobic digestor facility and is screened for contaminants. A wide range of organic waste can be processed, including food and green waste, animal slurries, and sewage.<\/li>\n<li>The organic waste it then treated to ensure a smooth fluid consistency in preparation for transfer to a digestion unit. Digestion units run at either mesophilic (around 20\u201345\u2103) or thermophilic (around 50\u201360\u2103) temperature ranges depending on the type of microorganisms present.<\/li>\n<li>Once in the digestion unit, the organic waste undergoes several processes of decomposition, including hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. The resulting by-products are methane biogas, which can be supplied to the grid or converted to biofuel, and a concentrated nutrient-rich fertiliser called digestate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1020\" height=\"419\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-1024x421.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-1024x421.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-300x123.png 300w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-768x315.png 768w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-1536x631.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-500x205.png 500w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion-800x329.png 800w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/Anaerobic-Digestion.png 1804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<strong>Processing time<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nThe whole process takes approximately 2\u20136 weeks depending on the system temperature.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Types of waste processed<\/strong>\n\u00a0\nA wide range of food waste, green waste, animal slurry, and sewage can be processed owing to the controlled closed-system environment of anaerobic digestion.\n\u00a0\n<strong>Advantages<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>AD can process a wide range of organic material.<\/li>\n<li>Biogas and digestate, two useful by-products of AD, can be harvested from the process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/compost-machine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"676\" src=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter-768x519.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter-500x338.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/TMK-1000-Composter-800x541.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<p>TMK produces a wide variety of different models of food waste recycling machines,\u00a0<strong>from 2kgs to 300 tons<\/strong>, in order to meet the composting needs of your large or small business.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/compost-machine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TMK Composting Machine<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\nTMK composter is committed to helping the globe achieve zero food waste by providing automatic organic waste composting solutions and systems for all kinds of businesses and homes.
