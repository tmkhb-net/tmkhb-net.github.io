As per the new rules, it has been advised that bio-degradable waste should be processed, treated, and disposed of through composting or bio-methanation within the premises.<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tmkhb.com\/compost-machine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Organic Waste to Compost Machine<\/strong><\/a><br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nThe machine enables the conversion of all types of food waste into compost.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nOur food waste machine is a fully automatic and highly compact composting machine that uses special techniques to break down and decompose all kinds of organic waste into compost within 24 hrs with a volume reduction of 80-90%. The entire process is natural and biological.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nOur food waste machine has a composting tank with a humidity sensor, heater, mixing blades, moisture control system, and air ventilation system.<br \/>\n\u00a0<br \/>\nWhen organic\/food waste is added to it, the shredder shreds organic\/food waste into small pieces and transfers all shredded material to the compositing tank. An artificial atmosphere for quick decomposing is created In the machine. At the same time, our special composting enzyme and sawdust mixture decomposes the organic waste into compost and this happens within 24 hours. That\u2019s how we achieve 85-90% volume reduction. The process is noiseless and odor free.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Leave your contact information to get a quotation!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>[contact-form-7 id=&#8221;2659&#8243; title=&#8221;Inquiry&#8221;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are happy to inform you about the launching of our n [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3150,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"elementor_header_footer","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[4],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3141"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3141"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3141\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3141"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3141"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/tmkhb.net:2030\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3141"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
