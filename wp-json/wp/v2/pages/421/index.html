Example \u2013 kitchen waste, garden waste.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is organic waste composter?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\tA machine used for the treatment and recycling of organic waste or wet garbage. A composter is a self-contained system capable of performing micro-organism-based composting in controlled conditions.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nOrganic waste converter results in a small carbon footprint, thus avoiding polluting emissions into the atmosphere and resulting in a usable end product \u2013 Organic Fertilizer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What happens if some non-biodegradable like plastic bags etc enter the machine?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Biological processes in the machine are not affected by small quantities of non-biodegradable material. However, these materials occupy valuable space in the machine and should be avoided. These materials may be removed from the machine through observation windows, wherever provided. Otherwise, they come out along with the compost from the outlet of the machine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What happens if the machine is loaded with excess material?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>TMK Composter is designed to handle 20% excess material. However, if more organic waste is loaded, output compost will not be fully cured. Also, there are chances of foul smell.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Can the output be used immediately?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The output can be used immediately. However, a further curing period ranging from 2 to 4 weeks is recommended.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">How can I make organic compost by bio-degradable waste?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>You should go for organic waste composting machine instead of traditional composting techniques. This is the best option for organic composting of bio-degradable waste on your premises. The basic working principle of this machine is that it is an aerobic decomposing process (no odour, no pathogenic activity) occurring in a chamber. The output that we get is nothing but manure, which can be used as fertilizer for gardening.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is the best way to oxidise organic waste?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Aerobic decomposting process is the best solution for oxidised organic waste. These aerobic microorganisms use the oxygen present and lose hydrogen. All oxidising reactions are exothermic, so we can use thermophilic bacteria (eg. Bacillus species) in a closed vessel with blower. This will mature organic waste to oxidise.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is the per-day processing capacity of the machine?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>It depends on the model you wish to purchase. For eg. TG-CC-500 has 500kg per day organic waste processing capacity.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Does TMK composter give out any harmful gases?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No gases as there is aerobic digestion taking place i.e. continuous air intake and air outlet.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What can go into the TMK\u2019s Composter?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Items to be placed in:<\/strong> Food Waste, Fish, Fish Bones, Meat, Meat Bones, Poultry, Poultry Bones, Vegetables, Fruits, Fruits &amp; Vegetable Peels, Pasta, Rice, Bread &amp; Pastry, Egg-Shells, Manure, Faeces &amp; Yard Waste Cattle, Horse, Dog, Yard Trimmings.<br><strong>Items to be avoided:<\/strong> Plastics, Metal Objects, Construction Waste, Textiles, Wood\/Wooden Objects, Coconut-Shells.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Can the Organic Fertilizer be used directly in gardens\/fields?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes. The organic fertilizer can be used directly in gardens or plants. Since it is concentrated it needs to be mixed with soil in the proportion of 10:1 (soil: compost) and then added to the plants.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Does it need to be on 24 hours?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Yes, the machine has to be connected to the source for 24 hours. However, it consumes power only 8 to 11 hours depending on the humidity content of the waste. However, the air supply blower and the electronic circuit would operate for 24 hours.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is the quantity of compost produced per day?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Approximately 10% to 15% of the organic waste input is converted to compost.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What happens to the odor?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The odor is controlled under the Deodorization System, which comes as a part of the machine.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Does the composter require a skilled operator?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>No. As it is fully automatic, the garbage collector can just open the lid and dump the segregated waste into it.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is the warranty or guarantee for the machine?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>12 months warranty is provided on manufacturing defects only.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What can I do with the Organic Fertilizer?<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>It can be used for the gardens in the premises as a soil nutrient.<\/li>\n<li>It can be sold to fertilizer companies or on e-commerce websites like Amazon where it can fetch USD20\/KG or more.<\/li>\n<li>It can be donated to the nearby nurseries or to the farmers and you can be a contributor to the development of the nation.<\/li>\n<li>A local government body might collect the compost depending upon where you are.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t<h3>INFORMATION REQUEST<\/h3><p>Interested in a Demo?
